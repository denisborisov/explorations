# Pointers

* Q
    * What is the difference betweend a pointer and a reference?
* A
    * Pointer semantics.
        * A poiter is nullable.
        * You can declare a pointer without assigning it a value.
        * When you assign a different value to a pointer, it starts pointing at another object.
    * Reference semantics.
        * A reference cannot be assigned null.
        * You must assign a value to a reference at the moment of declaration.
        * When you assign a different value to a reference, the assignment operator is called.
